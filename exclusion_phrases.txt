Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Significance levels: * p¬†<¬†0.05, ** p¬†<¬†0.01, *** p¬†‚©Ω¬†0.001.
A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.
Critical F-ratio significance for ANOVA was set at p<0.01 corresponding to q<0.003 or a false discovery rate of only 0.3%.
Statistical significance, tested by the Student‚Äôs t-test is indicated (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, ***P < 0.0005).
P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical testing was 2 sided with a threshold of statistical significance at p<0.5.
P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference
P values were considered significant at P¬†< 0.05.
P values were considered significant at P¬†< 0.05 (*P¬†< 0.05 vs.
P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05 was considered statistically significant.
P‚Ää>‚Ää0.05 indicates that there is no obvious publication bias, while P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05 shows a certain publication bias.
Threshold for significance was set at P < 0.05.
The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was employed to assess the quality of the data obtained and the risk of bias in each study.36 All tests were two-sided and the threshold for significance was set at P < 0.05.
Significance was set at unadjusted P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05, as no significant differences in gene expression remained after multiple testing correction (false discovery rate).
A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
Significance levels: * p¬†<¬†0.05, ** p¬†<¬†0.01, *** p¬†‚©Ω¬†0.001.
A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.
